## Problem Statement: Tic Tac Toe Game with Players names and Scorecard

Develop a web-based Tic Tac Toe game for two players that allows them to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player achieves a winning pattern or the game ends in a draw. 

The application should be able to accept the player names as input, and track each player's victories against their respective names.

**Requirements:**

1) **Interface Design:**

   a) Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS for the game board and the scorecard.

   b) Provide 2 text boxes for inputing the names of Player X and Player O.
   
   c) Display a 3x3 grid where players can place their marks (X or O) within the individual cells.

   c) Show a scorecard that tracks the number of wins for each player against their names.

2) **Game Logic:**

   a) Implement game logic in JavaScript to handle player turns and interactions.

   b) Allow two human players to take turns marking the grid with their respective symbols (X or O).

   c) Validate each move to ensure it is made on an empty cell.

   d) Detect a winning pattern (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) and declare the winning player.

   e) Implement a mechanism to detect a draw (all cells filled without a winner).

3) **Scorecard Feature:**

   a) Integrate a scorecard that displays the number of wins for each player against their names.

   b) Update the scorecard after each game to reflect the outcome (increment the winning player's score or declare a draw).

4) **User Interaction:**

   a) Take the players name as input via text box and display live scores against their names.
   
   b) Enable players to click or interact with the grid cells to place their marks.

   b) Provide clear feedback on the current game state, including whose turn it is, the winner, or a draw.

   c) Update the scorecard dynamically to reflect the latest scores.

5) **Responsive Design:**

   a) Ensure the game and scorecard are responsive and playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Constraints:**

1) Use vanilla JavaScript for implementing game logic without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

2) Ensure compatibility with major modern web browsers.

**Deliverables:**

1) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files comprising the game and scorecard feature.

2) A video recording of functional Tic Tac Toe game accessible via a web browser.

3) Source code with comments explaining the logic and structure for future reference or modifications. Zip it

**Push the code in HTML, CSS and JS, along with a demo video of your solution into the github repo.**
